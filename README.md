# Gestures
Project Overview:
Project Title: Detecting shoulder, hands, and face moments

Description: This project is designed to analyze videos and extract meaningful information related to human body language. It specifically focuses on detecting and tracking head and hand positions, identifying shoulder lines, and recognizing shoulder shrugging events within the video content.

# How It Works:
Input Video: The project takes as input a video file (e.g., final.mp4) placed in the project directory.

Video Processing: The Python script utilizes several libraries and techniques to analyze the video frame by frame:

Hand Tracking: It uses the Mediapipe library to detect and track hands in each frame. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected hands.

Face Detection: OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier is employed to detect faces in the video frames. The script tracks the position of the detected head.

Shoulder Line Detection: The script calculates the position of the shoulders based on the head's position. It extracts and processes regions around the shoulders to identify shoulder lines.

Shoulder Shrugging Detection: The project tracks changes in shoulder lines throughout the video frames. When a significant change is detected (indicating a shoulder shrug), the script annotates the frame with text to highlight the event.

Visualization: The project provides various visualizations in real-time as it processes the video:

Bounding boxes around detected hands.
A rectangle around the detected head.
Colored lines indicating the position of the shoulder lines.
Text overlaid on frames where shoulder shrugging is detected.
Customization: Users have the flexibility to customize the script's parameters and thresholds to adapt it to different video characteristics or scenarios.

# Usefulness:
Body Language Analysis: This project can be valuable for researchers, therapists, or anyone interested in analyzing body language cues in video content. It provides a visual representation of hand and head movements, aiding in the study of non-verbal communication.

Gesture Recognition: By tracking hand movements, it can be used for recognizing and interpreting gestures made by individuals in videos, which could be useful in various applications, including sign language interpretation.

Shoulder Shrugging Detection: Identifying shoulder shrugging events can be applied in psychology, human behavior studies, or even for monitoring stress levels in individuals.

Customizable: The script's customizability allows it to be adapted for various video datasets, making it a versatile tool for different research or analysis needs.

Educational: This project can serve as an educational resource for those interested in computer vision, video analysis, and human pose estimation.

Overall, your project provides a powerful tool for understanding and extracting valuable information from video content related to human body language and movements, with potential applications in diverse fields.
